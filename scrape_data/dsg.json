Make your best submission for the challenge that goes live on 13th March, with different problem Statements for 1y and 2y, and climb your way to the leaderboard. Get your skills sharpened till then, explore through Kaggle and DSG-provided resources.\n\n3. Blog-a-thon: Got conceptual clarity like no one else? If you feel you can intuitively understand algorithms and concepts and can make them explainable to others as well, publish those thoughts in your head and make your thinking astonish us!\n\nWell, we are no professors that can teach you Data Science 0 to 100. So, it only makes it fair if people don't have to go through a test to get in either. There will be NO pen-and-paper test for recruitments, so now only your own efforts can make you come around here.

Well, we are about to learn that only!\n\nIn NeuS, we propose to represent a surface as the zero-level set of a signed distance function (SDF) and develop a new volume rendering method to train a neural SDF representation. We observe that the conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e. bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that is free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to more accurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experiments on the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset show that NeuS outperforms the state-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially for objects and scenes with complex structures and self-occlusion.\n\nDate: 15th July\nTime: 10:00 pm\nPlatform: DSG Discord Server",
