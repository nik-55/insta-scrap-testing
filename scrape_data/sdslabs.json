Bring your own chargers and extension cables.\n2. We have Geolocation + IP logging built into our platform, being on campus but not at LHC will be considered malpractice.\n3. Our test platform has ML-based Audio and video proctoring with real-time face-tracking.\n4. You will be required to take the test in fullscreen mode, any attempt at exiting it will be penalized\n5. We log all key presses and take regular audio video samples for manual inspection\n6. This test is NOT for design recruitments. Designers may skip it.\n\nAll the best! See you there :)\n\nPS: @blocsociitr has preponed its test timings from 6PM to 4:30PM. This is to clarify any confusion regarding clashes in test timings.",

Knowing this will ease the process for you: https://pureinfotech.com/check-gpt-mbr-partition-windows-10/\n\nAlso, knowing the boot mode the system uses is useful.

SDSLabs is back with our annual hackathon, Syntax Error 2021.\n\nWhat is a hackathon?\nA hackathon is a short, fast-paced event (typically of 1-2 days) in which participant teams think of an innovative idea and develop a prototype of the envisioned product. The event concludes with a presentation of the product to the judges in an attempt to convince them that this can be the next big thing. And if you are successful you get those sweet prizes.\nBut prizes aren't the main attraction of a hackathon, it is the satisfaction you get from seeing your code running, the lessons you learn from what is not running, the excitement you get from trying out a new thing, the fun interactions between participants in helping each other out and a lot more.\n\nSyntax Error 2021 will be a 36-hour hackathon starting on 8th January 2021. You can Register and check out the FAQ section on https://hackathon.sdslabs.co/\n\nLooking for teammates?\nJoin this FB Group to find and connect with more participants https://www.facebook.com/groups/198447694257165\n\nStay tuned here for further updates!",
